  const message = `dear riko,

hi hi. i hope this little letter feels like a warm hug and not a disturbance. i promise iâ€™m not here to stir anything or bring any heavinessâ€”i just really, truly wanted to greet you the happiest birthday ever.

i know iâ€™ve made mistakes. i know i may not be the kind of friend you deserve. and maybe thereâ€™s still a part of you that feels hurt because of me and thatâ€™s okay. you donâ€™t have to rush yourself or forgive me if youâ€™re not ready. your feelings are valid. youâ€™re allowed to feel them, completely and without question.

but even with all that said, i just couldnâ€™t let your birthday pass without saying something (there are things iâ€™ve been carrying in my heart that i just want you to know). because riko... thank you. thank you for everything. for being part of my life, even if it was only for a chapter, it was a chapter that mattered a lot. being your friend was one of the most special, comforting, and joy-filled things iâ€™ve ever experienced. thank you for laughing with me, listening to me, and just existing next to me in this strange little world. meeting you was such a magical thing. you might not even realize it, but you were one of the brightest parts of my life.. and i miss it. i miss you.

thank you for making me laugh during days when i didnâ€™t even want to wake up. thank you for staying, even when i wasnâ€™t at my best. i know iâ€™ve made mistakes. i know iâ€™ve hurt you, and nothing i say can undo that. i carry the weight of those regrets with me, not because i want to rewrite the past, but because i want you to know that my remorse is real. i mean it when i say iâ€™m sorry, and i know that sorry will never be enoughâ€”but itâ€™s a piece of my heart that i still want to give you. i just want you to know that i see you, the real you, and iâ€™ve always cared in ways i mightâ€™ve failed to show. you donâ€™t know this, but you were one of the reasons i made it through. you were one of the reasons iâ€™m still here. you reminded me that life could still be soft and beautiful. you made me want to try again. to live again. and that means more than words could ever say.

iâ€™m so proud of you. youâ€™re no longer bending yourself just to please everyoneâ€”and that makes me so happy. youâ€™re choosing your peace, and i hope it leads you somewhere full of warmth and sunshine and quiet happiness. youâ€™ve always deserved that kind of life, riko. you really have.

and if ever, one day, the world starts to feel too loud againâ€”if you ever feel like youâ€™ve run out of people who are on your sideâ€”please know that iâ€™m still here. quietly. always rooting for you from afar. you still have me. and even if we're not close anymore, youâ€™ll always have a soft place to return to with me. no questions asked.

i regret what i did. so much. it was just one jokeâ€”but it hurt you, and i didnâ€™t mean for that to happen. if i could turn back time, i would. i wouldâ€™ve chosen my words better. i wouldâ€™ve protected your heart instead of carelessly breaking it. iâ€™m so sorry, riko. i never wanted to hurt youâ€”not even for a second.

i still love you. as a friend, as a person who once knew your laughter and your quiet thoughts and your kindness. iâ€™ll always treasure that. and iâ€™ll always be hereâ€”silent, steady, and ready to welcome you back, if ever that day comes.

happy birthday, riko. may this new year of your life be kind, magical, and full of love you donâ€™t have to question.

with all the love my heart can hold,
nyca lynne.`;
